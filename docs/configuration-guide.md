# Configuration Guide
Slackcat may be configured via a simple or advanced configuration

## Simple Configuration

Generate a new Slack token with:
```bash
slackcat --configure
```
A new browser window will be opened for you to confirm the request via Slack, and you'll be returned a token.

Create a Slackcat config file and you're ready to go!
```bash
echo '<your-slack-token>' > ~/.slackcat
```

## Advanced Configuration

Advanced configuration allows for multiple Slack teams, a default team and default channel

#### Example ~/.slackcat Config
```bash
team1 = <team1-slack-token>
team2 = <team2-slack-token>
default_team = team1
default_channel = general
```
By default, all messages will be sent to the team1 general channel.

#### Example Usage

Post a file to team1 #general channel:
```bash
slackcat /path/to/file.txt
```

Post a file to team1 #testing channel:
```bash
slackcat -c testing /path/to/file.txt
```

Post a file to team2 #testing channel:
```bash
slackcat -c team2:testing /path/to/file.txt
```
